This calculator was completly worten by myself. It also my first project that without tutorial.

But here still have a few promble that I don't know how to fix it.
1. the number digits limit: I can't controle the digits on top of the calculator panle. It will disappear when the number is very large or take a lot of digits.
2. calculation array can't synchronize with newCalculation varible: I don't know how to turn newCalculation value into calculation array. This promble will show up when finish one round of calculate.

Hope one day I can find out how to fix it.
Maybe next time I can write more easier and clearify.
